Broadcom Linux hybrid wireless driver (64-bit)
The following kernel modules are incompatible with this driver and should not be loaded:
* ssb
* bcma
* b43
* brcmsmac

Make sure to unload (`rmmod` command) and blacklist those modules in order to prevent them from being automatically
reloaded during the next system startup:

`/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf`
```
# wireless drivers (conflict with Broadcom hybrid wireless driver 'wl')
blacklist ssb
blacklist bcma
blacklist b43
blacklist brcmsmac

After installtion dont forget to 
# modprobe wl 
  reboot
